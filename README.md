# Rick and Morty Project

Project created to practice Next.js and its core features such as Static Site Generation (SSG), Server-side Rendering (SSR), pages, and API routes. The website uses the Rick and Morty API to provide dummy data for front-end and back-end practice. TypeScript/JavaScript is used as the core language.

The back-end was built using Next.js handlers (with fully typed req and res) and API routes. The front-end communicates with the back-end through RTK Query provided by Redux-Toolkit.

User authentication (using JWT) and other data are stored in a NoSQL database, MongoDB, without using Mongoose.

The front-end uses CSS Modules for simple and fast styling. The core fundamentals of React were applied, and the state management is handled by React Toolkit and its features such as slices and dispatch functions.
